Execute the below SQL script and answer the question that follows:


CREATE table fruits (fruit_name varchar(10));
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Orange');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Apple');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);

Write a query that returns the count of 4. You'll need to count on the column fruit_name and not use COUNT(*)

HINT: You'll need to use an additional function inside of count to make this work.

select COUNT(coalesce (fruit_name, 'NONE'))

from fruits;
